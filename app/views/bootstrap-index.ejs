      Music professor Emily Dolan is co-leading a graduate seminar with a colleague of hers, Jonathan Stern (Professor of Culture and Technology at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec). Seminars met in parallel on each campus, connecting via video conference for group disussions every other week. Two in-person meetings also took place, with each group of students visiting the opposite campus during their spring break. The Bok Center met several times with Dolan in the fall, providing support for the technological requirements (by purchasing and supporting equipment that HUIT was unable to furnish) and developing various models for conducting a large humanities seminar via video conference. We also consulted with music department staff about renovations to their seminar room, which took place in January.

      Bok Center staff and fellows also worked directly with Dolan and her students for the first few seminar meetings, offering technical support and experimenting with new solutions. In the end, the seminar settled on a model in which each professor facilitated live discussion among students via video chat, supplemented by a live text backchannel (via Google Docs), on which students shared ideas, references, and links. At the end of the semester, the Bok Center conducted interviews with graduate students from Harvard and McGill, collecting their reactions and experiences, and their reflections on the seminar's emergent meta-theme: in a class on instruments and instrumentality, the classroom *itself* was revealed as an instrument of teaching and learning.

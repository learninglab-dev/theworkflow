              Music professor Emily Dolan is co-leading a graduate seminar with a colleague of hers, Jonathan Stern (Professor of Culture and Technology at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec). Seminars met in parallel on each campus, connecting via video conference for group disussions every other week. Two in-person meetings also took place, with each group of students visiting the opposite campus during their spring break. The Bok Center met several times with Dolan in the fall, providing support for the technological requirements (by purchasing and supporting equipment that HUIT was unable to furnish) and developing various models for conducting a large humanities seminar via video conference. We also consulted with music department staff about renovations to their seminar room, which took place in January.
